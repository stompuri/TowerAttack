TowerAttack
===========
The idea for this game is to reverse the roels in the game genre of tower defender. As normally in the tower defender games the player is the defender and the computer attack wave after wave, in this game the player takes the attacker role. The player upgrades and buys units and tries to break the defence.

The development for this game started via the game engine architecture course organized by the University of Helsinki (Computer Science). The course project included development of the persistence (save/load) system. After the course I continued the development to create a computer version of the board game I had developed earlier.
